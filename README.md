# DRAG: Document-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

DRAG (Document-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an extractive-style Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to improve coherence, relevance, and semantic fidelity over traditional chunk-based extractive methods. Unlike conventional RAG approaches that split documents into chunks, DRAG performs **query-based summarization at the document level**, leveraging **graphical representations** and **graph-theoretic reasoning** to generate context-aware, fluent responses.
